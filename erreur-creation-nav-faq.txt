RSSOwl fails to create a Browser for reading news (Linux)!

Note: Beginning with RSSOwl 2.1, a new logic was implemented to find a browser to use within RSSOwl. The steps are as follows:

First try the OS configured browser if present
Second, use the browser that is specified from the -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath argument if provided
Third, try to use the browser that is bundled with RSSOwl
If the error persists even with RSSOwl 2.1, follow these instructions to manually install a browser to use with RSSOwl:
This error can be seen on Linux where RSSOwl tries to create an embedded Browser for reading news, but fails. RSSOwl is relying on a proper XULRunner version to be installed. Please make sure to have XULRunner 1.9.2.x installed on your system. RSSOwl can not use XULRunner 2 and above. XULRunner 2 was first introduced with Firefox 4 in 2011. Instructions:
Download XULRunner 1.9 Runtime
Extract it to any directory that RSSOwl can read
Add a new startup property to rssowl named -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=[XULRunner Runtime Directory]
Start RSSOwl and it will pick up the browser from the provided location
Please refer to this FAQ entry how to start RSSOwl with parameters like that.
